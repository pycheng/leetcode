20180424 1_twosum.c - time complexity O(n^2), space complexity O(n)
20180424 167_twosum_2.c - time complexity O(n^2) The hard part is the index traisition
20180425 2_addtwonums.c -not finished, the answer overflowed. should be care ful about the int length 
20180426 412_fizzbuzz.c - watch the char** malloc
20180426 823_binary_tree_with_factors.c**  continue to fix timeout limit,   double to fix overflow problem  #Dynamic Programing 
20180430 70_clibing_stairs.c dynamic programming in 10 mins, recursive in 5 mins
20180430 822_card_flipping.c kind of brain storm... when you get the hint solve it in O(n)
